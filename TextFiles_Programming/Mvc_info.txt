MVC (Framework)

- tempdata maily between action to action.
- Viewbag.variable should be different for every viewbag.
- viewdata passing information from action to view (only) typecasted when used. communication is action to action then data are lost.

how to start:
1: add controller.
2: add an action to the controller.
3: add a view to the action.

route can be changed, eg. routing in App_Data --> RouteConfig, index is default.

- viewbag simplest to work with. 

MVC (Core) - helper? dependency injections?

- Partial view is a part of another view.
- create once use it several times.
- add model, the controller (properties and contructor)
- make a List<Student> for example in controller above the first action.
